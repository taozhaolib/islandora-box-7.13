# Islandora Sync [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_sync.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_sync)

## Introduction

Islandora Sync enables event-based synchronization of content between Fedora Commons and Drupal. Fedora content models may be mapped to Drupal node types and Fedora datastreams and their XML contents to Drupal fields. A more in-depth overview of the module's use and configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_sync/wiki/Islandora-Sync-Use-and-Configuration).

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)
* [Field API](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!field!field.module/group/field/7)
* [Field UI](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!field!field.module/group/field/7)
* [Relation](https://drupal.org/project/relation)

## Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

Islandora Sync Relation provides integration with the [Relation module](www.drupal.org/project/relation) for syncing Fedora object to object relationships as Drupalnode to node relationships.

Islandora Sync Field Collection integrates with the Field Collection module to allow for repeating groups of fields, similar to tabs of Islandora XML Forms.

## Configuation

/admin/structure/types/manage/<node_bundle_machine_name>/fedora
