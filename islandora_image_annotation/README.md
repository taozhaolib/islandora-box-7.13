# Islandora Image Annotation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_image_annotation.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_image_annotation)

## Introduction

Adds the ability to add annotations to images.  This solution pack piggy backs on top of other Islandora Solution Packs such as [Basic Image](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_image/) and [Large Image](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_large_image/) by adding a new tab to existing views. This tab includes the annotation tools.


## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)
* [Basic Image Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_image/)
* [Large Image Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_large_image/)

## Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

To enable the annotation tab for a content model visit Administration » Islandora » Image Annotation (admin/islandora/image_annotation). From there you can choose which CModels
you want to integrate the annotation tool with.  You will need to tell it what datastream to use as well, You should choose a datastream with a mimetype of image/jpeg or image/png. The Taxonomy Column allows the annotation tool to use taxonomy terms for categories.

Annotation categories also depend on the selected radio button under Annotation Categories. If you want to depend on taxonomies choose administrator defined.

![Configuration](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3c2af45923ee5ec1608098ea26fc09c107a82175/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4348307a5673382e706e67)

### Customization

Searching:

Included is an xslt designed for gsearch.  If this xslt is included in your existing gsearch index xslt it will index the Annotation fields and make them searchable in solr.  You will also need to configure the Islandora Solr client so that it is aware of the new fields.  If you are using custom Solr request handlers you will have to update them as well.

If you have solr configured properly and have Annotation Categories set as user defined you will have a type ahead for the Annotations categories section.
