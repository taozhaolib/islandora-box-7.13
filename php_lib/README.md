# PHP Lib

## Introduction

PHP Lib is a collection (or 'library') of interfaces, classes and functions that are used by a variety of Islandora modules, most notably the Forms modules. It is used primarily to create pages that convert records in XML formats to a more human-readable version that is also able to be easily manipulated. This is done by a series of PHP files that Drupal includes when loading these pages.
