# Islandora Batch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_batch.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_batch)

## Introduction

This module implements a batch framework, as well as a basic ZIP/directory ingester.

The ingest is a two-step process:

* Preprocessing: The data is scanned, and a number of entries created in the
  Drupal database.  There is minimal processing done at this point, so it can
  complete outside of a batch process.
* Ingest: The data is actually processed and ingested. This happens inside of
  a Drupal batch.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)


# Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

N/A

### Usage

The base ZIP/directory preprocessor can be called as a drush script (see `drush help islandora_batch_scan_preprocess` for additional parameters):

`drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_batch_scan_preprocess --type=zip --target=/path/to/archive.zip`

This will populate the queue (stored in the Drupal database) with base entries.

For the base scan, files are grouped according to their basename (without extension); DC, MODS or MARCXML in a *.xml or binary MARC in a *.mrc will be transformed to both MODS and DC, and the first entry with another extension will be used to create an "OBJ" datastream. Where there is a basename with no matching .xml or .mrc, some XML will be created which simply uses the filename as the title.

The queue of preprocessed items can then be processed:

`drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_batch_ingest`

### Customization

Custom ingests can be written by [extending](http://github.com/Islandora/islandora_batch/wiki/How-To-Extend) any of the existing preprocessors and batch object implementations.
